Web Service API & Documentation
=================

We have a webservice API that can be used, with the correct authentication, to<br />
interact with our website. This API is used by other groups to send authors on<br />
our site.<br />

Our API Document is available on https://www.distribution.social/swagger

Test Cases
=================
We have test cases for API and Model testing.

To run tests: `python manage.py test`<br />

These tests check if our API and models are working properly.<br />

AJAX Documentation
=================
We used AJAX to show local and foreign profile.
We used AJAX when liking and commenting things.
We used AJAX for getting posts, comments, and likes.
We used AJAX because we wanted it on the fly and request data from foreign servers which takes some time to arrive.
